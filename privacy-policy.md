Last updated: July 8, 2025

Man·π£at al-Sul·π≠ƒÅn ("we", "our", "us") values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information provided through our mobile application.

1. Data Collection
We do not collect any personal information for tracking or advertising purposes.

We only collect limited data to provide core functionality of the app, such as:

Name, email, and phone number when voluntarily submitted during account registration.

Uploaded photos and videos by the user for assignments or profile images.

Diagnostic data (such as crash reports) to improve app stability.

None of this data is shared with third parties or used for tracking across apps or websites.

2. Use of Data
All collected data is used solely for the following purposes:

Enabling user login and secure account access.

Submitting assignments or profile pictures.

Providing customer support.

Improving app functionality and resolving technical issues.

We do not use any data for marketing, third-party advertising, or behavioral tracking.

3. Photos and Videos
The app may request access to your media library (photos and videos), but only when you manually choose to upload a file. We do not access your media automatically or in the background.

4. Analytics
We use basic usage analytics to improve app performance. These statistics are anonymous and not linked to personal identity.

5. Security
We use commercially reasonable means to protect your data. However, no internet transmission is 100% secure. Users are encouraged to use strong passwords and protect their accounts.

6. No Third-Party Login
The app does not use third-party login systems such as Google or Facebook. All authentication is managed locally within the app through our own server.

7. Changes to Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be communicated in-app or via email.
